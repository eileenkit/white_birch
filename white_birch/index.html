<h2>RECENT REVIEWS</h2>
<p>"We had a amazing family vacation at White Birch Resort. The "reunion house #2" we stayed in was beautiful and plenty big enough to accommodate our family of 13 with room to spare. The kids enjoyed the inflatables, pool and of course our hot tub on the porch...which the adults also really enjoyed. It was a great week!! The weather cooperated even if the fish did not. Just a good reason to try it again another year. Monty and Sandy were great hosts and filled our every wish (oops! Almost...no drink blender). All said...we had a GREAT time!! Dora & Ray L."</p>
<p>"I just returned from a stay at White Birch and I had a great time. The resort is family oriented and our two children, ages 8 and 10, really enjoyed themselves. We fished, played in the sand, swam, played horseshoes, explored Blackduck and some of the local attractions and made lots and lots of S'Mores! Monte and Sandy were always available to answer any questions and make suggestions on fishing spots and good restaurants." Jason P.</p>
